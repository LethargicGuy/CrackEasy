# CrackEasy
A WiFi cracking script which eases the process of bruteforcing and capturing handshakes.

## Prerequisities:
* You need to have a WiFi adapter which supports monitor mode and packet injection.
* A linux distro running Debian or debian based OS or Arch or Arch based OS would be nice.

## Instructions:
* Clone this repository.
```
git clone https://github.com/k4u5h4L/CrackEasy.git
```
* Change file permissions to executable.
```
chmod +x wifi_wpa.sh
```
* Execute the script with root permissions
```
sudo ./wifi_wpa.sh
```
The script installs packages required for the attack automatically.
The packages are available in Debian and Arch official repositories.
Happy cracking!!
